# Learning 😃📚💻

A place to put some of the code for things I'm learning

## Distributed Systems

Distributed Systems was one of my favorite classes in college and I'm learning Go at the moment to fill in some of my knowledge and build better systems. I'll also be applying what I learned while learning FP, ML, and my Python skills. My end goal is to fill in knowledge gaps, deploy my own ML model on a distributed system and make sure it's efficent

## Functional Programming

Since  all of my classs are focused on OOP, we never have learned functional programming. In order to become a better programmer I want to learn about functional programming. I feel like it will help my code logic, writing less buggy code, provide a new way of thinking how to approach problems, and create interesting challenges.

For the purpose of this I will be learning through Python even though it doesn't have Immutiability built into the langauge, it is easy to read, write quickly, and test. At the end of this I will create a larger project coded in a functional programmimng way or a hybrid with OOP.

## Data Structures

Python Folder contains implementations of common data structures to help me learn them better. As time goes on I will be rewriting those common data structures in other languages to compare them across languages, see what is easier to implement where, and also learn the data strucutre/language better
