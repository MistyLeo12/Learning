# Learning

A place to put some of the code for things I'm learning outside of school 

## Functional Programming 
Since  all of my classs are focused on OOP, we never have learned functional programming. In order to become a better programmer I want to learn about functional programming. I feel like it will help my code logic, writing less buggy code, provide a new way of thinking how to approach problems, and create interesting challenges.

For the purpose of this I will be learning through Python even though it doesn't have Immutiability built into the langauge,
it is easy to read, write quickly, and test. At the end of this I will create a larger project coded in a functional programmimng way or a hybrid with OOP.
